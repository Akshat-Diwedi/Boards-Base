# Organic Chemistry : Hydrocarbon Basics

Think of hydrocarbons as the fundamental building blocks of organic compounds, just like different tech stacks for molecular structures. We're talking carbon and hydrogen, playing well together.

## 1. Saturated vs. Unsaturated Hydrocarbons

Before diving into the "alk-" series, let's categorize:

- **Saturated Hydrocarbons**: These are the stable ones. All carbon atoms are connected by **single bonds (C−C)**. They're "saturated" because they hold the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible. No fancy double-clicking here.
  
- **Unsaturated Hydrocarbons**: These are your dynamic, reactive types. They contain at least one **double bond (C=C)** or **triple bond (C≡C)** between carbon atoms. They're "unsaturated" because they can add more hydrogen atoms across those multiple bonds. Think of them as having open ports for more connections.

## 2. The "Alk-" Families: Alkanes, Alkenes, Alkynes

### 2.1. Alkanes ($Cn​H2n+2$​)

- **Suffix**: `-ane`
- **Bonding**: All **single bonds** ($C−C$).
- **Nature**: Saturated hydrocarbons. The most stable and least reactive.
- **Analogy**: The HTML of organic chemistry – foundational, stable, gets the job done.

- **Examples**:
    - **Methane ($CH4​$)**: Smallest alkane, 1 carbon.
    - **Ethane ($C2​H6$​)**: 2 carbons.
    - **Propane ($C3​H8$​)**: 3 carbons.

### 2.2. Alkenes ($Cn​H2n$​)

- **Suffix**: `-ene`
- **Bonding**: At least one **carbon double bond ($C=C$)**.
- **Nature**: Unsaturated hydrocarbons. More reactive than alkanes.
- **Analogy**: JavaScript – more dynamic, more possibilities than just static HTML.
- **Key Point**: 'n' must be ≥2 (you need at least two carbons for a double bond).

- **Examples**:
    - **Ethene ($C2​H4$​)**: Also known as ethylene.
    - **Propene ($C3​H6​$)**:

### 2.3. Alkynes ($Cn​H2n−2$​)

- **Suffix**: `-yne`
- **Bonding**: At least one **carbon-carbon triple bond ($C≡C$)**.
- **Nature**: Unsaturated hydrocarbons. Even more reactive than alkenes.
- **Analogy**: Node.js – real-time, highly reactive, built for high-performance tasks.
- **Key Point**: 'n' must be ≥2 (you need at least two carbons for a triple bond).

- **Examples**:
    - **Ethyne ($C2​H2​$)**: Also known as acetylene.
    - **Propyne ($C3​H4$​)**:

## 3. Alkyl Groups ($Cn​H2n+1$​)

- **Suffix**: `-yl`

- **What they are**: These aren't standalone compounds, but rather **fragments** or **substituents**. An alkyl group is formed when you **remove one hydrogen atom from an alkane**.

- **Function**: They act like reusable components (think React) that can attach to other molecules, forming more complex structures.

- **Nomenclature**: Take the alkane name and just swap `-ane` for `-yl`.

- **Examples**:
    - From Methane ($CH4$​) → **Methyl** ($CH3​$)
    - From Ethane ($C2​H6​$) → **Ethyl** ($C2​H5​$)
    - From Propane ($C3​H8$​) → **Propyl** ($CH3​CH2​CH2​$) or **Isopropyl** ($CH3​CH(CH3​)$)
