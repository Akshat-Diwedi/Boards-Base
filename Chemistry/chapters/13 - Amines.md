## 🎯 Core Concepts to Master

### 1. Classification and Nomenclature
- Classification as primary, secondary, and tertiary amines.
- IUPAC names of amines.

### 2. Methods of Preparation
- From nitro compounds (reduction), nitriles, amides (Hofmann bromamide degradation).

### 3. Physical and Chemical Properties
- **Basicity of Amines**: Effect of substituents, solvent, and steric factors on basicity.
