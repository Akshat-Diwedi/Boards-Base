**Marks Weightage**: 12 marks

## üéØ Core Concepts to Master

### 1. Basic Terms
- **Coordination Compound**: A compound containing a central metal atom or ion bonded to a number of ions or neutral molecules (ligands).
- **Ligand**: An ion or molecule that binds to a central metal atom to form a coordination complex.
- **Coordination Number**: The number of ligand donor atoms to which the metal is directly bonded.
- **Coordination Sphere**: The central atom and the ligands attached to it.

### 2. Werner's Theory of Coordination Compounds
- Introduced the concept of primary (ionizable) and secondary (non-ionizable) valencies.

### 3. Nomenclature of Coordination Compounds
- IUPAC rules for naming coordination compounds.

### 4. Isomerism in Coordination Compounds
- **Structural Isomerism**: Linkage, coordination, ionization, and solvate isomerism.
- **Stereoisomerism**:
    - **Geometrical Isomerism**: cis-trans isomerism in square planar and octahedral complexes.
    - **Optical Isomerism**: Enantiomers in octahedral complexes.

### 5. Bonding in Coordination Compounds
- **Valence Bond Theory (VBT)**: Explains the formation of complexes using hybridization.
- **Crystal Field Theory (CFT)**: Describes the splitting of d-orbitals in the presence of ligands.

## üìù Board Exam Focus Areas
- IUPAC nomenclature of coordination compounds.
