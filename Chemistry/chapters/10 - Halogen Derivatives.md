# Chapter 10: 
**Marks Weightage**: 12 marks

## üéØ Core Concepts to Master

### 1. Classification
- **Haloalkanes and Haloarenes**: Based on the type of carbon atom to which the halogen is attached.
- **Monohalogen, Dihalogen, etc.**: Based on the number of halogen atoms.

### 2. Nomenclature
- IUPAC names of halogen derivatives.

### 3. Methods of Preparation
- **Haloalkanes**: From alcohols, hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes).
- **Haloarenes**: By electrophilic substitution.

### 4. Physical and Chemical Properties
- **Nature of C-X bond**.
- **Reactions of Haloalkanes**:
    - **Nucleophilic Substitution (SN1 and SN2)**: Reactions with aqueous KOH, NH‚ÇÉ, KCN, etc.
    - **Elimination Reactions (E1 and E2)**: Reaction with alcoholic KOH.
    - **Reaction with Metals**: Grignard reagent formation, Wurtz reaction.
- **Reactions of Haloarenes**:
    - **Nucleophilic Substitution**: Under drastic conditions.
    - **Electrophilic Substitution**: Halogenation, nitration, sulfonation, Friedel-Crafts reaction.

### 5. Environmental Effects
- Polyhalogen compounds like DDT, freons.

## üìù Board Exam Focus Areas
- Understanding the mechanism of SN1 and SN2 reactions.
- Wurtz reaction and Friedel-Crafts reaction.
- Explaining why haloarenes are less reactive than haloalkanes towards nucleophilic substitution.
- Name reactions like Finkelstein, Swarts, and Sandmeyer reaction.

## 4. Most important and repeated topics !!
