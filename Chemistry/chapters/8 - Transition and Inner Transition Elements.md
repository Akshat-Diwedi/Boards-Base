## 🎯 Core Concepts to Master

### 1. Transition Elements (d-block)
- **Position in the Periodic Table**: Groups 3 to 12.
- **Electronic Configuration**: General configuration (n-1)d¹⁻¹⁰ ns¹⁻².
- **General Properties**:
    - **Variable Oxidation States**: Due to the small energy difference between (n-1)d and ns orbitals.
    - **Formation of Colored Ions**: Due to d-d transitions.
    - **Magnetic Properties**: Paramagnetism due to unpaired electrons.
    - **Catalytic Properties**: Ability to show variable oxidation states.
    - **Formation of Complexes**: Due to small size and high charge of ions.
    - **Formation of Alloys**: Due to similar atomic sizes.
- **Potassium Permanganate (KMnO₄) and Potassium Dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇)**: Preparation and oxidizing properties.

### 2. Inner Transition Elements (f-block)
- **Lanthanoids**:
    - **Electronic Configuration**: [Xe] 4f¹⁻¹⁴ 5d⁰⁻¹ 6s².
    - **Lanthanoid Contraction**: The steady decrease in atomic and ionic radii with increasing atomic number.
    - **Oxidation States**: Commonly +3, with some elements showing +2 and +4.
- **Actinoids**:
    - **Electronic Configuration**: [Rn] 5f¹⁻¹⁴ 6d⁰⁻¹ 7s².
    - **Actinoid Contraction**: Similar to lanthanoid contraction.
    - **Oxidation States**: Show a wider range of oxidation states than lanthanoids.
