# Chapter 2:
**Marks Weightage**: 10 marks

## üéØ Core Concepts to Master

### 1. Types of Solutions
- Understanding solutions as homogeneous mixtures of solids, liquids, or gases in a liquid solvent.

### 2. Concentration of Solutions
- Expressing concentration in terms of molarity, molality, and mole fraction.

### 3. Solubility
- **Henry's Law**: The solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas over the solution.
- **Raoult's Law**: For a solution of volatile liquids, the partial vapor pressure of each component is directly proportional to its mole fraction.

### 4. Colligative Properties
- Properties that depend on the number of solute particles, not their nature.
    - **Relative Lowering of Vapor Pressure**
    - **Elevation in Boiling Point**
    - **Depression in Freezing Point**
    - **Osmotic Pressure**
- **van't Hoff Factor (i)**: Accounts for the effect of dissociation or association of solute particles on colligative properties.

## üìù Board Exam Focus Areas
- Stating and explaining Raoult's Law and Henry's Law.
- Numerical problems based on colligative properties to determine molar mass of a solute.
- Understanding the concept of van't Hoff factor and its application in problems.
- Distinguishing between ideal and non-ideal solutions.

## 4. Most important and repeated topics !!
