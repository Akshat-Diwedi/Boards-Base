## 🎯 Core Concepts to Master

### 1. Thermodynamic Terms
- **System and Surroundings**: Defining the part of the universe under study and everything else.
- **Types of Systems**: Open, closed, and isolated systems.
- **State Functions**: Properties that depend only on the state of the system (e.g., pressure, volume, temperature).
- **Path Functions**: Properties that depend on the path taken (e.g., heat, work).

### 2. First Law of Thermodynamics
- **Statement**: Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only converted from one form to another.
- **Mathematical Expression**: ΔU = q + w
- **Work Done**: Expression for pressure-volume work (w = -PΔV).

### 3. Enthalpy (H)
- **Enthalpy Change (ΔH)**: Heat absorbed or evolved in a reaction at constant pressure.
- **Relationship between ΔH and ΔU**: ΔH = ΔU + Δn₉RT
- **Enthalpy of Reactions**: Standard enthalpy of formation, combustion, and Hess's Law.

### 4. Spontaneity
- **Spontaneous Process**: A process that occurs without any external influence.
- **Entropy (S)**: A measure of disorder or randomness in a system.
- **Second Law of Thermodynamics**: The total entropy of a system and its surroundings increases in a spontaneous process.
- **Gibbs Energy (G)**: G = H - TS. For a spontaneous process, ΔG must be negative.
- **Relationship between ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS**: ΔG = ΔH - TΔS.

## 📝 Board Exam Focus Areas
