## üéØ Core Concepts to Master

### 1. Acids and Bases Theories
- **Arrhenius Theory**: Acids produce H‚Å∫ ions and bases produce OH‚Åª ions in water.
- **Br√∏nsted-Lowry Theory**: Acids are proton donors, and bases are proton acceptors.
- **Lewis Theory**: Acids are electron-pair acceptors, and bases are electron-pair donors.

### 2. Ionization of Acids and Bases
- **Dissociation Constant (K‚Çê and K‚Çë)**: Equilibrium constants for the ionization of weak acids and bases.
- **Ostwald's Dilution Law**: Relates the dissociation constant of a weak electrolyte with its degree of dissociation and concentration.

### 3. pH and pOH
- **pH**: The negative logarithm of the H‚Å∫ ion concentration.
- **pOH**: The negative logarithm of the OH‚Åª ion concentration.
- **Relationship**: pH + pOH = 14 at 298 K.

### 4. Hydrolysis of Salts
- The reaction of cations or anions of a salt with water to produce an acidic or basic solution.
- Understanding the pH of solutions of salts of:
    - Strong acid and strong base (neutral)
    - Strong acid and weak base (acidic)
    - Weak acid and strong base (basic)
    - Weak acid and weak base (depends on K‚Çê and K‚Çë)

### 5. Buffer Solutions
- **Acidic Buffer**: A mixture of a weak acid and its salt with a strong base.
- **Basic Buffer**: A mixture of a weak base and its salt with a strong acid.
- **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation**: Relates the pH of a buffer solution to the pK‚Çê and the ratio of the concentrations of the salt and acid.

### 6. Solubility Product
- **Solubility Product (K‚Çõ‚Çó)**: The equilibrium constant for a solid solute dissolving in an aqueous solution.
- **Common Ion Effect**: The suppression of the ionization of a weak electrolyte by the addition of a strong electrolyte that has an ion in common with the weak electrolyte.
