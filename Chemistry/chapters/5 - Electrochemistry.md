**Marks Weightage**: 12 marks

## üéØ Core Concepts to Master

### 1. Electrolytic and Metallic Conduction
- Understanding the difference between the flow of electrons (metallic) and the flow of ions (electrolytic).

### 2. Electrolytic Cells
- **Electrolysis**: Decomposition of an electrolyte by passing a direct current.
- **Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis**: Quantitative aspects of electrolysis.

### 3. Galvanic (Voltaic) Cells
- Spontaneous redox reactions are used to generate electricity.
- **Daniel Cell**: A common example of a galvanic cell.
- **Salt Bridge**: Its function in a galvanic cell.

### 4. Electrode Potential
- **Standard Electrode Potential (E¬∞)**: The potential of an electrode under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 1 atm pressure, 298 K).
- **Electrochemical Series**: Arrangement of electrodes in order of their standard reduction potentials.

### 5. Nernst Equation
- Relates the cell potential to the standard cell potential and the concentrations of the reacting species.

### 6. Batteries
- **Primary Cells**: Non-rechargeable (e.g., Dry cell).
- **Secondary Cells**: Rechargeable (e.g., Lead storage battery).
- **Fuel Cells**: Convert the energy of combustion of fuels directly into electrical energy (e.g., H‚ÇÇ-O‚ÇÇ fuel cell).

## üìù Board Exam Focus Areas
