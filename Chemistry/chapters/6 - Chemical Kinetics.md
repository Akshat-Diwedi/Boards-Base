## üéØ Core Concepts to Master

### 1. Rate of a Chemical Reaction
- **Average and Instantaneous Rate**: Defining and calculating the rate of reaction.
- **Rate Law**: An expression that relates the rate of a reaction to the concentration of reactants.
- **Order and Molecularity**: Understanding the difference between these two concepts.

### 2. Integrated Rate Laws
- **Zero-Order Reactions**: Rate is independent of the concentration of reactants.
- **First-Order Reactions**: Rate is directly proportional to the concentration of one reactant.
- **Half-life (t‚ÇÅ/‚ÇÇ)**: The time required for the concentration of a reactant to reduce to half its initial value.

### 3. Collision Theory of Chemical Reactions
- For a reaction to occur, reactant molecules must collide with sufficient energy (activation energy) and proper orientation.
- **Activation Energy (E‚Çê)**: The minimum energy required to start a chemical reaction.

### 4. Temperature Dependence of Reaction Rates
- **Arrhenius Equation**: Relates the rate constant of a reaction to temperature and activation energy.

### 5. Effect of Catalyst
- A catalyst increases the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative pathway with lower activation energy.

## üìù Board Exam Focus Areas
- Differentiating between order and molecularity of a reaction.
