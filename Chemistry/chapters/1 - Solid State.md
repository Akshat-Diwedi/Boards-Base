**Marks Weightage**: 8 marks

## üéØ Core Concepts to Master

### 1. Crystalline and Amorphous Solids
- **Crystalline Solids**: Have a regular, repeating arrangement of particles over a long range. They possess sharp melting points.
- **Amorphous Solids**: Have a random, disordered arrangement of particles. They melt over a range of temperatures.

### 2. Types of Crystalline Solids
- **Ionic Solids**: Constituent particles are ions held by electrostatic forces. (e.g., NaCl)
- **Covalent Network Solids**: Atoms are linked by a continuous system of covalent bonds. (e.g., Diamond, Quartz)
- **Molecular Solids**: Molecules are held together by intermolecular forces. (e.g., Ice, Solid CO‚ÇÇ)
- **Metallic Solids**: Metal ions are surrounded by a sea of mobile electrons. (e.g., Copper, Iron)

### 3. Crystal Lattices and Unit Cells
- **Unit Cell**: The smallest repeating structural unit of a crystalline solid.
- **Types of Unit Cells**:
    - **Simple Cubic (sc)**: Particles only at the corners.
    - **Body-Centered Cubic (bcc)**: Particles at corners and one in the center of the body.
    - **Face-Centered Cubic (fcc)**: Particles at corners and at the center of each face.

### 4. Packing in Solids
- **Close Packing**: Efficient arrangement of spheres in one, two, and three dimensions.
- **Voids**: Empty spaces between packed spheres.
    - **Tetrahedral Voids**: Surrounded by four spheres.
    - **Octahedral Voids**: Surrounded by six spheres.
- **Packing Efficiency**: The percentage of total space filled by particles in a crystal lattice.

### 5. Crystal Defects
- **Point Defects**: Imperfections around a single point in a crystal.
    - **Schottky Defect**: Equal number of cations and anions are missing from the lattice.
    - **Frenkel Defect**: An ion is displaced from its normal lattice site to an interstitial site.
- **Impurity Defects**: Foreign atoms are present in the crystal lattice.

## üìù Board Exam Focus Areas
- Distinguishing between crystalline and amorphous solids.
- Calculating the number of atoms in a unit cell (sc, bcc, fcc).
- Problems based on the relationship between density, molar mass, and unit cell edge length.
- Understanding and identifying Schottky and Frenkel defects.

## 4. Most important and repeated topics !!
- **Calculation of packing efficiency** for simple cubic, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic lattices.
- **Numerical problems** to calculate the density of a unit cell.
- **Distinction between Schottky and Frenkel defects**.

## üîó Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of states of matter and intermolecular forces (from Class 11).
