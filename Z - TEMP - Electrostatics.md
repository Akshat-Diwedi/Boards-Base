# Chapter 8: Electrostatics  
**Marks Weightage**: 6 marks (without options) / 4 marks (with options)

## 🎯 Core Concepts to Master

### 1. Electric Charge & Coulomb’s Law
- **Electric charge**: Conserved, quantized; SI unit = coulomb (C).
- **Coulomb’s law** : $$( F = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} );$$ vector addition via the superposition principle.

### 2. Electric Field & Flux; Gauss’s Law
- **Electric field intensity**: \( E = \frac{F}{q} \); field due to point charge \( E = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \).
- **Gauss’s law**: Electric flux through a closed surface equals enclosed charge divided by \( \varepsilon_0 \). Applications—plane sheet, spherical shell.

### 3. Electric Potential & Energy
- **Electric potential (V)**: Potential energy per unit charge; includes potential from point charges, dipoles.
- **Potential energy**: Of two point charges or dipoles in an external field; equipotential surfaces explained.

### 4. Capacitors & Dielectrics
- **Capacitance**: \( C = \frac{Q}{V} \), energy stored \( U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \).
- **Combined capacitors**: Series & parallel; dielectric effects on capacitance.

### 5. Conductors, Insulators & Displacement Current
- Behavior of conductors in electrostatic fields; free vs bound charges.
- Displacement current concept.

### 6. Special Topics
- Uniformly charged infinite plane sheet and thin spherical shell—field inside & outside.
- **Van de Graaff generator**: Principle, construction, working.
