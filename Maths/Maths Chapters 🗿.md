### Monthly Targets 🎯:


##### September 15 :

| No. | Chapters                 | Marks | Status |
| --- | ------------------------ | ----- | ------ |
| 1.  | Mathematical Logic       | 8     | ❌      |
| 3.  | Trigonometric Functions  | 10    | ❌      |
| 14. | Probability Distribution | 5     | ❌      |
| 15. | Binomial Distribution    | 5     | ❌      |
- after that rest 15 days of September will be used to do revision of the chapters .
