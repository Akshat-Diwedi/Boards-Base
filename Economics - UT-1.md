## 2) Easy-to-learn definitions and short explanations (same order)

> Use these as definitions to paste into notes. Keep them short, clear, exam-friendly.

1. **Introduction (Micro & Macro)**  
    Study of economics splits into two viewpoints: micro (small parts — individual decisions) and macro (whole economy — aggregates).

2. **Historical review of Microeconomics**  
    Micro analysis developed earlier; classical thinkers (Adam Smith, Ricardo) and Alfred Marshall popularized price theory and individual behaviour analysis.

3. **Historical review of Macroeconomics**  
    Macroeconomic thinking existed earlier but became a formal approach after the 1930s — Keynes’ _General Theory_ (1936) established modern macro policy analysis.

4. **Microeconomics (meaning)**  
    The branch of economics that studies the behaviour and decisions of individual units — consumers, firms, and markets for particular goods and services.

5. **Definitions of Microeconomics (summary)**
    
    - _**Maurice Dobb** :_ Microeconomics is a microscopic study of the economy.
        
    - _**A. P. Lerner** :_ Microeconomics looks through a microscope at the many “cells” (households, firms) of the economy.

6. **Scope of Microeconomics**  
    Study of individual demand and supply, price formation of individual products, factor pricing, resource allocation, and welfare at the micro level.

7. **Demand analysis**  
    Study of how individual consumers decide quantity demanded at different prices, holding other things constant (income, tastes).

8. **Supply analysis**  
    Study of how individual producers decide quantity supplied at different prices, given production costs and technology.

9. **Theory of product pricing**  
    Explains how the price of a single commodity is determined by the interaction of its demand and supply.

10. **Theory of factor pricing**  
    Determines rewards to factors of production:
    
    - **Rent** — payment for land.
    - **Wage** — payment for labour.
    - **Interest** — payment for capital.
    - **Profit** — return for entrepreneurship and risk.

11. **Theory of economic welfare**  
    Study of how resources can be allocated to maximize society’s satisfaction (efficiency and equity considerations).

12. **Efficiency in production**  
    Producing the maximum output from given inputs (no waste of resources).

13. **Efficiency in consumption**  
    Distributing goods so that the total satisfaction of society is maximized.

14. **Overall economic efficiency**  
    Producing the goods and services most desired by people given available resources.

15. **Features of Microeconomics**
    
    - **Study of individual units:** focus on single households/firms.
    - **Price theory:** explains prices of goods and factors.
    - **Partial equilibrium:** studies equilibrium of one market holding others constant.
    - **Ceteris paribus assumptions:** simplifies analysis by holding other factors fixed.
    - **Slicing method:** split economy into parts and study each.
    - **Marginalism:** decisions are made at the margin (marginal cost, marginal benefit).
    - **Market structure analysis:** different behaviours under perfect competition, monopoly, etc.
    - **Limited scope:** does not address aggregate problems like national unemployment directly.

16. **Importance of Microeconomics**  
    Explains price formation, helps businesses choose costs/prices, aids government policy (tax, subsidy), helps understand trade effects, and builds economic models.

17. **Macroeconomics ( meaning )**  
    The branch of economics that studies the behaviour and performance of an economy as a whole — aggregates like national income, overall employment, inflation, total demand and supply.

18. **Definitions of Macroeconomics (summary)**
    
    - _J. L. Hansen:_ Macroeconomics considers relationships among large aggregates (employment, savings, investment, national income).
        
    - _Carl Shapiro:_ Macroeconomics deals with the functioning of the economy as a whole.

19. **Scope of Macroeconomics**  
    Includes national income and employment, general price level and inflation, aggregate consumption and investment, growth and development, distribution of income, and business cycles.

20. **Theory of income and employment**  
    Explains what determines national income and the level of employment (consumption function, investment function, multiplier effects).

21. **Theory of general price level and inflation**  
    Studies what determines the average level of prices across the economy and causes of inflation/deflation.

22. **Theory of economic growth and development**  
    Explains long-run increase in an economy’s productive capacity and policies to reduce underdevelopment and poverty.

23. **Macro theory of distribution**  
    Studies how national income is shared among rent, wages, interest, and profit.

24. **Features of Macroeconomics**
    
    - **Study of aggregates:** national income, total employment, price level.
    - **Income theory:** focus on measurement and behaviour of national income.
    - **General equilibrium analysis:** relationships among aggregate demand, supply and prices.
    - **Interdependence:** changes in one aggregate affect others.
    - **Lumping method:** looks at whole economy rather than parts.
    - **Growth models:** formal models to study development strategy.
    - **Focus on general price level.**
    - **Policy-oriented:** informs fiscal and monetary policies (Keynesian emphasis).

25. **Importance of Macroeconomics**  
    Helps understand overall economic functioning, control business cycles, design development strategies, measure performance (NI), and study employment levels.

26. **Micro vs Macro — quick contrast**
    
    - **Micro:** individual units, price theory, partial equilibrium, slicing method.
    - **Macro:** aggregates, income theory, general equilibrium, lumping method, policy focus.

27. **Exercises / typical questions**  
    Standard chapter questions include defining micro and macro, listing scope/features/importance, comparing micro & macro, explain the role of Keynes, identify examples of micro and macro analysis, and multiple choice/correlations.

## Part 2 — Easy-to-learn definitions (same order; copy-friendly)

### 1. Introduction to Utility

**Utility** — the ability (power) of a good or service to satisfy human wants.

---

### 2. Features of Utility

- **Relative concept** — utility changes with time and place (e.g., wool useful in winter).
    
- **Subjective concept** — utility depends on the individual’s tastes and situation.
    
- **Ethically neutral** — utility simply measures want-satisfaction, not whether the want is good or bad.
    
- **Utility vs Usefulness** — utility = capacity to satisfy wants; usefulness = value in actual use.
    
- **Utility vs Pleasure** — something may give utility but not pleasure (e.g., a painful injection that cures).
    
- **Utility vs Satisfaction** — utility causes consumption; satisfaction is the result.
    
- **Measurement is hypothetical** — utility is abstract; cardinal numbers are an assumption for analysis.
    
- **Multi-purpose** — a good can serve many uses/people.
    
- **Depends on intensity of want** — stronger wants give higher utility.
    
- **Basis of demand** — people demand only what gives them utility.
    

---

### 3. Types of Utility

- **Form utility** — created by changing the form/shape (e.g., wood → furniture).
    
- **Place utility** — created by moving goods to where they’re needed (transport).
    
- **Service utility** — from services provided by people (doctor, teacher).
    
- **Knowledge utility** — when information increases usefulness of a product (knowing a phone’s features).
    
- **Possession utility** — arises on transfer/ownership (when buyer owns the good).
    
- **Time utility** — created by making goods available at the right time (e.g., exam books during exams, blood bank).
    

---

### 4. Concepts: Total Utility & Marginal Utility

- **Total Utility (TU)** — sum of utility from all units consumed.
    
- **Marginal Utility (MU)** — extra utility from consuming one more unit.
    

**Formulas:**

```
TU = Σ MU
MU_n = TU_n − TU_(n−1)
```

- **Point of satiety** — TU is maximum; MU = 0.
    
- **Disutility** — MU becomes negative after satiety (consumption becomes harmful).
    

---

### 5. Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility ( DMU )

**Statement (Marshall):** Other things being equal, the additional benefit from each extra unit of a thing diminishes as total stock increases.

**Plain English:** The more you have of something, the less extra satisfaction each new piece gives you.

**Key assumptions:** rational consumer; utility measurable cardinally; homogeneous units; continuity (quick succession); reasonable unit size; related factors constant; divisibility; single want.

**Interpretation of MU curve:** MU falls with each unit; MU hits zero (satiety), then becomes negative.

---

### 6. Exceptions to DMU (why it might _not_ hold)

- **Hobbies/collections:** extra items can increase pleasure.
- **Miser:** extra money may increase their satisfaction.
- **Addictions:** apparent rising MU for each extra unit (illusion).
- **Power:** wanting more power may increase desire.
- **Money:** debate — MU of money may not fall for everyone.

_(Textbook : these are “apparent exceptions” because they violate assumptions.)_

---

### 7. Criticisms of the Law

- Relies on unrealistic assumptions (e.g., perfect homogeneity).
    
- Cardinal measurement of utility is questionable (utility is psychological).
    
- Not applicable to indivisible/bulky goods (car, fridge).
    
- MU of money may not be constant.
    
- Real people face many wants at once, not a single want.


---

### 8. Significance of DMU

- **Consumers:** encourages diversification to get maximum total utility.
    
- **Government:** helps design tax and pricing measures (progressive tax uses MU of money idea).
    
- **Paradox of value:** explains why necessities (high TU, low price) and luxuries (low TU, high price) coexist.
    
- **Law of demand:** DMU underlies why demand falls as price rises.


---

### 9. Relationship: MU and Price

- Convert MU into money terms to compare with price.
    
- **Consumer buys units while MU (in money terms) ≥ Market price.**
    
- Definitions:
    
    - **Intra-marginal units:** MU > Price (consumer willingly buys).
        
    - **Marginal unit:** MU = Price → consumer equilibrium.
        
    - **Extra-marginal units:** MU < Price (consumer won’t buy).
        

**Equilibrium rule:**

```
MU_x = P_x
```

(Consumer maximizes satisfaction when marginal benefit equals marginal cost/price.)

---

### 10. Indifference / Ordinal Note

Indifference curve analysis (Hicks & Allen) replaces cardinal utility with ordinal rankings — a more realistic alternative when cardinal measurement is rejected.

---

## Part 3 — Important / Most-asked items (exam-ready Qs, one-line crisp answers, copy-paste friendly)

> Use these as flashcards or short answers in exams. I put the **question** then the **one-line model answer**.

1. **Define utility.**  
    Utility is the capacity of a commodity to satisfy human wants.

2. **List five features of utility.**  
    Relative, subjective, ethically neutral, multi-purpose, depends on intensity of want.

3. **What is form utility? Give an example.**  
    Utility created by changing form; e.g., clay → toys.

4. **Define total utility (TU).**  
    TU is the aggregate satisfaction from all units of a commodity consumed.

5. **Define marginal utility (MU).**  
    MU is the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit.

6. **Write the relation between TU and MU.**
    

```
TU = Σ MU
MU_n = TU_n − TU_(n−1)
```

7. **Explain point of satiety.**  
    The stage where TU is maximum and MU = 0; further consumption causes disutility.

8. **State the law of diminishing marginal utility.**  
    As more units of a commodity are consumed, the extra satisfaction from each additional unit tends to decline, ceteris paribus.

9. **List three main assumptions of DMU.**  
    Rationality of consumer; homogeneity of units; divisibility/continuity of consumption.

10. **Give two exceptions to DMU.**  
    Collections (stamps), addictions (apparent rising MU).

11. **Criticize the law of DMU in one line.**  
    It relies on unrealistic assumptions and on cardinal measurement of a psychological concept.

12. **How does DMU explain the law of demand?**  
    As MU falls with more consumption, consumers will only buy extra units at lower prices — causing demand to fall as price rises.

13. **Convert MU to money — why?**  
    To compare marginal benefit with market price and decide whether to buy another unit.

14. **Define intra-marginal, marginal and extra-marginal units.**  
    Intra: MU > P (buy); Marginal: MU = P (equilibrium); Extra-marginal: MU < P (won’t buy).

15. **Consumer equilibrium condition (single good, price taken as given).**
    

```
MU_x = P_x
```

16. **Difference between utility and satisfaction (2 lines).**  
    Utility is the capacity to satisfy (cause); satisfaction is the fulfilled state (effect).

17. **Explain paradox of value in one line.**  
    Some necessities (high total use-value) can be cheap while rarities (low use-value) are expensive due to marginal valuation.

18. **Draw TU and MU curves — key shape notes (for quick sketch).**  
    TU: rising, flattens at maximum, may fall later.  
    MU: downward sloping, crosses X-axis at satiety, becomes negative after.

19. **Why is MU sometimes negative?**  
    Because beyond satiety, extra consumption creates dissatisfaction (disutility).

20. **Why is indifference curve analysis introduced?**  
    To avoid dubious cardinal measurement by using ordinal preferences and budget constraints.


---

## Quick "cheat-sheet" formulas & graph points (for boards / short answers)

- TU = Σ MU.
    
- MU_n = TU_n − TU_(n−1).
    
- Consumer equilibrium: MU_x = P_x.
    
- Point of satiety: MU = 0, TU maximum .

---

## Suggested one-line strategy for answering long questions (exam style)

- **Q:** "Explain DMU with assumptions and exceptions."  
    **A:** State the law (1 sentence), list 5–6 assumptions (bulleted), illustrate with short table or graph (draw TU & MU), mention major exceptions and say why they are only apparent (they violate assumptions). Finish with 1-line significance.
